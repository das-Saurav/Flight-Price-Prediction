# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict flight ticket prices based on multiple factors such as airline, route, duration, and number of stops. The goal is to assist airlines and travel platforms in optimizing dynamic pricing strategies and help customers get better price estimates.

# Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
Models Used: Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor
Evaluation Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAPE, etc

# Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
